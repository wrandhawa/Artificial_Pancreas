# Artificial_Pancreas
Mock Artificial Pancreas for proof of concept regarding the automation of insulin and glucagon pumps
The mock Artifical Pancreas uses Arduino-based C++ to mimick the functionality of the pancreas including insulin (exclusively for the single hormone version) and glucagon (for the digital hormone version). The dual hormone accounts for mistakes incase the inslin overshoots and the motor is delayed. 
The dual hormone uses insulin and glucagon.
